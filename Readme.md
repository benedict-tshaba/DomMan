# DomMan

## DomMan is a very light weight JavaScript DOM manipulation library.
## I wrote this code as a way to learn how jQuery works and as a way to understand vanilla JavaScript a lot better.

### I add methods as I see fit, for example when I am working on a project that requires something that this library currently does not support then I will add it.
### The idea is to have a light weight library that can be used for minimal DOM manipulation work. I will not add anymore methods than I need, this is not an attempt to create a 'full' DOM manipulation library like jQuery, but instead I am trying to create it such that it has the minimal amount of required features for any project but not more than that.
